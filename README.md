# 📦 Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM) Practicals – Semester VI

> **Name:** Shreyash Daduria  
> **PRN:** 22070521194  
> **Section:** B  
> **Semester:** VI  

Welcome to my **Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM)** practical repository, developed as part of my **Semester VI coursework**.  
This repository contains hands-on implementations of various DWM concepts such as **data preprocessing**, **ETL transformations**, **OLAP operations**, and **machine learning algorithms** used in data mining.
