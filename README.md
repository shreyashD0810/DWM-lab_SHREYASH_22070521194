Welcome to my **Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM)** practical repository, developed as part of my **Semester VI coursework**.  
This repository contains hands-on implementations of various DWM concepts such as **data preprocessing**, **ETL transformations**, **OLAP operations**, and **machine learning algorithms** used in data mining.
