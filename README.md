Welcome to my **Data Warehousing and Mining (DWM)** practical repository, developed as part of my **Semester VI coursework**.  
This repository contains hands-on implementations of various DWM concepts such as **data preprocessing**, **ETL transformations**, **OLAP operations**, and **machine learning algorithms** used in data mining.

## 🧪 Practicals Overview

### 1️⃣ Handling Missing Values in Python  
🔧 Implemented techniques like:
- Mean/Mode imputation  
- Interpolation  
- Null value removal  

---

### 2️⃣ Data Flow Transformations in ETL ⚙️  
Performed ETL-based transformations including:
- Filtering  
- Aggregation  
- Schema mapping  

---

### 3️⃣ OLAP Operations on Multi-Dimensional Data Cube 📊  
Explored:
- Roll-up  
- Drill-down  
- Slice and Dice operations  

Worked with multi-dimensional data for analytical insights.

### 4️⃣ Apriori Algorithm for Frequent Itemset Mining 🛒  
- Implemented Apriori to discover frequent itemsets  
- Generated association rules using support & confidence thresholds  

---

### 5️⃣ Naïve Bayes Classifier 🤖  
- Applied Naïve Bayes for probabilistic prediction  
- Used for basic text classification  

---

### 6️⃣ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 📌  
- Implemented KNN for classification  
- Tested performance across different K-values  

---

### 7️⃣ K-Means Clustering 🔍  
- Performed unsupervised clustering  
- Visualized cluster formation using Python visualization libraries  

---

### 8️⃣ Decision Tree Algorithm 🌲  
- Built a decision tree classifier  
- Used information gain and entropy to determine splits  

---

### 9️⃣ Linear Regression 📈  
- Analyzed relationships between variables  
- Evaluated model using RMSE and R² score  

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

These practicals provided me with real-world exposure to:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing  
- ETL and transformation pipelines  
- OLAP for business analytics  
- Core machine learning models (supervised & unsupervised)
